i got a case study to be developed using ASP.net, Entityframework core . I will provide you that and you have to tell me the detailed step by step procedure to develop the application.


Online Cooking Recipe Portal System The aim of this Cooking Recipe Portal project is to develop an online system by utilization of which a user can learn different sorts of the formula. This framework can be useful for a café or to the teacher who instructs the cooking as they can spread their formula to the next. The user can likewise post their formula on the site. As the Cooking Recipe Portal framework will be founded on the web, the user can take in the formula from wherever and can see the formula any number of times. The users can offer input to the formula.

COOKING RECIPE PORTAL MODULE:
Registration: If a user wants to share the recipe has to register to the system by providing 
essential details to the system.
Login: The user will need to login to access their profile. Only the logged in person can upload 
or delete the recipe. During login, the user needs to give ID and password to the system.
Profile: Through this module, the user can edit the details about them.
Recipe: This module will divide the information about the different method according to the 
types of vegetarian, non-vegetarian or according to the state so that it will be easy to find any 
recipe

2. Design the Database (Using EF Core Code-First)
Entities:
User
UserId, Username, Email, PasswordHash, IsAdmin, ProfileInfo
Recipe
RecipeId, Title, Description, Ingredients, Steps, Category, IsVegetarian, State, CreatedDate, UserId
Feedback
FeedbackId, RecipeId, UserId, Comment, Rating, CreatedDate
Relationships:
One-to-Many: User → Recipes
One-to-Many: Recipe → Feedback
🧠 3. Create the Data Layer
Create ApplicationDbContext class inheriting from DbContext.
Define DbSet<T> for each entity.
Configure relationships using Fluent API or Data Annotations.


Great! Since you're using JWT for authentication and Angular for the frontend, the architecture will follow a decoupled client-server model. Here's a comprehensive step-by-step guide to build your Online Cooking Recipe Portal using:

ASP.NET Core Web API (Backend)
Entity Framework Core (ORM)
JWT Authentication
Angular (Frontend)
🧱 1. Project Structure Overview
CookingRecipePortal/
├── Backend/
│   ├── Controllers/
│   ├── Models/
│   ├── Data/
│   ├── Services/
│   ├── DTOs/
│   └── Program.cs
└── Frontend/
    └── AngularApp/

 2. Backend Setup (ASP.NET Core Web API + EF Core + JWT)
✅ Step 1: Create the Web API Project

✅ Step 2: Install Required Packages

✅ Step 3: Define Models
User, Recipe, Feedback
✅ Step 4: Configure EF Core
Create ApplicationDbContext and configure relationships.
Add connection string in appsettings.json.
✅ Step 5: Implement JWT Authentication
Create AuthController for login/register.
Generate JWT token on successful login.
Secure endpoints using [Authorize].
✅ Step 6: Create Controllers
AuthController: Register/Login
RecipeController: CRUD for recipes
FeedbackController: Add/view feedback
UserController: Profile management
🌐 3. Frontend Setup (Angular)
✅ Step 1: Create Angular App

✅ Step 2: Install Dependencies

✅ Step 3: Create Modules & Components
auth: login/register
recipes: list, add, edit, view
feedback: add/view
profile: view/edit
✅ Step 4: Setup JWT Interceptor
Automatically attach JWT token to HTTP requests.
✅ Step 5: Connect to API
Use Angular services to call backend endpoints.
🔐 JWT Authentication Flow
User registers → API stores hashed password.
User logs in → API returns JWT token.
Angular stores token in localStorage.
Angular sends token in Authorization header.
API validates token and authorizes access.
🧪 4. Testing & Deployment
Use Postman to test API endpoints.
Use Angular CLI to build and serve frontend.
Deploy backend to Azure App Service or Docker.
Deploy frontend to Netlify, Vercel, or Azure Static Web Apps.
Would you like me to generate the backend project structure with sample code (models, JWT setup, controllers), or the Angular frontend scaffolding next?

1. Registration Module
🔹 Real-Life Scenario:
Priya wants to share her grandmother’s traditional Karnataka-style Bisi Bele Bath recipe. She visits the portal and registers.

🔹 Entity Involved: User
Column	Description
UserId	Unique ID for each user
Username	Priya's chosen username
Email	Her email address
PasswordHash	Securely stored password
ProfileInfo	Optional bio or cooking interests
🔹 Flow:
Priya fills out the registration form.
Backend hashes her password and stores her info in the User table.
She receives a JWT token upon successful registration.
🔐 2. Login Module
🔹 Real-Life Scenario:
Priya returns to the site a week later to upload another recipe.

🔹 Flow:
She enters her email and password.
Backend verifies credentials and returns a JWT token.
Angular stores the token and uses it for authenticated requests.
👤 3. Profile Module
🔹 Real-Life Scenario:
Priya wants to update her profile to mention she specializes in South Indian cuisine.

🔹 Flow:
She navigates to the profile page.
Updates her ProfileInfo.
Backend updates the User table.
🍲 4. Recipe Module
🔹 Real-Life Scenario:
Priya uploads her Bisi Bele Bath recipe.

🔹 Entity Involved: Recipe
Column	Description
RecipeId	Unique ID for each recipe
Title	"Bisi Bele Bath"
Description	Short intro to the dish
Ingredients	List of ingredients
Steps	Step-by-step instructions
Category	"Main Course"
IsVegetarian	true
State	"Karnataka"
CreatedDate	Timestamp
UserId	Links to Priya's user ID
🔹 Flow:
Priya fills out the recipe form.
Backend saves the recipe linked to her UserId.
Other users can now view and try the recipe.
🗂️ 5. Recipe Filtering
🔹 Real-Life Scenario:
Ravi is vegetarian and wants to explore recipes from Punjab.

🔹 Flow:
He uses filters: IsVegetarian = true, State = "Punjab".
Backend queries the Recipe table with these filters.
Angular displays matching recipes.
💬 6. Feedback Module
🔹 Real-Life Scenario:
Ravi tries Priya’s recipe and wants to leave a comment.

🔹 Entity Involved: Feedback
Column	Description
FeedbackId	Unique ID for each feedback
RecipeId	Links to Priya’s recipe
UserId	Ravi’s user ID
Comment	"Loved it! Authentic taste."
Rating	5
CreatedDate	Timestamp
🔹 Flow:
Ravi submits feedback.
Backend stores it in the Feedback table.
Priya sees the feedback on her recipe page.
🔐 7. Authorization Logic
Only logged-in users can:
Upload recipes
Edit/delete their own recipes
Leave feedback
Admins (if implemented) can:
Manage users
Moderate content

✅ Project Summary
The Online Cooking Recipe Portal is a web-based platform where users can learn, share, and explore cooking recipes. It supports user-generated content, allowing individuals to upload their own recipes and interact with others through feedback.

🧩 Core Modules & Their Purpose
1. User Management
Registration: New users sign up with basic details.
Login: Authenticated access using JWT tokens.
Profile: Users can update their personal info.
2. Recipe Management
Users can create, view, edit, and delete their own recipes.
Recipes are categorized by:
Type: Vegetarian / Non-Vegetarian
Region: Based on Indian states (e.g., Punjab, Karnataka)
Recipes include: title, description, ingredients, steps, and metadata.
3. Feedback System
Logged-in users can comment and rate recipes.
Feedback helps improve recipe quality and user engagement.
🧠 Technical Architecture
🔧 Backend (ASP.NET Core Web API)
Entity Framework Core for database operations.
JWT Authentication for secure login and role-based access.
RESTful APIs for all modules (auth, recipes, feedback).
🌐 Frontend (Angular)
Angular SPA for a responsive and dynamic user experience.
JWT Interceptor to attach tokens to API requests.
Components for login, registration, recipe listing, feedback, etc.
🔗 Entity Relationships
User ↔ Recipe: One user can post many recipes.
Recipe ↔ Feedback: One recipe can have many feedback entries.
User ↔ Feedback: One user can leave feedback on many recipes.
🎯 Use Case Example
Priya registers on the portal, logs in, and uploads a traditional Karnataka-style Bisi Bele Bath recipe. Ravi, another user, tries it and leaves a 5-star rating with a comment. Priya updates her profile to mention her South Indian cooking expertise.
